This is a simple Neural Network that I created as part of my A-Level computer science cource in whitch I had to create a programming project of my choice.
for this project i deicided to create a simple Neural Network capable of identifying handwritten numetical digits. this Netural Network was trained using the MNIST dataset

the program makes use of the Tensor flow library to create the Neural Network and the pillow library to format the images and the tkinter library to create the UI.
